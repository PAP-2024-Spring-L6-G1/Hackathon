# PAP-2024-Spring-L6-G1 / Hackathon
Our final project is to create a responsive Hackathon website, enabling organization and submission by teams of users.

* [Live Website Demo](https://pap-2024-spring-l6-g1.github.io/Hackathon/)
* [Project Progress Tracking](https://github.com/orgs/PAP-2024-Spring-L6-G1/projects/2)
* [Canvas Assignment](https://computingforall.instructure.com/courses/224/assignments/4357?module_item_id=12005)

## Tools we used
* Shared git repository across the team
* Github Projects to organize and assign tasks
* Github Issues to track bugs and review solutions

## Challenges we encountered
* [GitHub Pages doesnâ€™t support routers that use the HTML5 `pushState` history API](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#notes-on-client-side-routing)
  * After some investigation, we found `HashRouter` to be an acceptable compromise
* Hosting our Express API backend on Render.com
  * To avoid local hosting, we wanted our backend to be accessible 24/7 from anywhere
  * Challenges with integrating with MongoDB - IP whitelist and using environment variables instead of .env file for secrets
* Our JWT data was missing the "exp" expiration time in the payload, so [our authentication library was removing the cookie immediately](https://github.com/react-auth-kit/react-auth-kit/issues/1653)
  * Fix: add an expiration to every token we sign
* Our authentication library does not refresh components when sign in state changes [Issue #1541]](https://github.com/react-auth-kit/react-auth-kit/issues/1541)
  * Workaround until v4 releases: force a `window.location.refresh()`
